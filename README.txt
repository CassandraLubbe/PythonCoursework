I'm only a student, still learning and growing.

This project contains some of my Python and Python Qt Designer coursework projects. These form part of my Bachelor of Science in Computing degree at the University of South Africa (UNISA).

This was my first attempt at using TURTLE.





TOTAL DAYS NEEDED CALCULATOR


As a freelance writer, I need to manage my time effectively. It also requires me to be able to provide clients with the total days needed to complete the novel without knowing what the future looks like and only having the total word count and the standard words per day to work off of.

This calculator takes the total word count of the book to be written, takes into account the days of the week you will be working, adds any public holidays to the total days needed to finish the project, and then provides an output of the total days need as well as the average words per day.
